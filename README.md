Assessment for Data Analyst Role (Tableau, Power BI)
Objective: Evaluate the candidateâ€™s proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and reporting
using Tableau and Power BI.
Part 1: Theoretical Knowledge
1. Understanding Data Visualization
Question: Explain the importance of data visualization in data analysis. What are the key
principles of effective data visualization?
Evaluation Criteria: Clarity of explanation, understanding of key principles.
2. Tableau Basics
Question: What are the main components of Tableau? Describe the process of creating a basic
dashboard in Tableau.
Evaluation Criteria: Understanding of Tableau components, step-by-step process.
3. Power BI Fundamentals
Question: Discuss the main features of Power BI. How does Power BI differ from Tableau in
terms of functionality and use cases?
Evaluation Criteria: Understanding of Power BI features, comparison with Tableau.
Part 2: Practical Application
4. Data Cleaning and Preparation
Problem Statement: Given a dataset with missing values and inconsistencies, clean and
prepare the data for analysis.
Requirements:
Use Python or R to perform data cleaning.
Document the steps taken to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
Evaluation Criteria: Correctness of data cleaning steps, clarity of documentation.
5. Tableau Visualization
Problem Statement: Create an interactive sales dashboard in Tableau using the provided sales
dataset. The dashboard should include key metrics such as total sales, sales by region, and
sales trends over time.
Requirements:
Use various charts (e.g., bar charts, line charts) to represent the data.
Implement filters to allow users to interact with the data.
Evaluation Criteria: Dashboard design, interactivity, and clarity of visualizations.
6. Power BI Report
Problem Statement: Develop a report in Power BI to analyze customer feedback data. The
report should highlight customer satisfaction levels, common issues, and trends over time.
Requirements:
Use visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and timelines.
Include slicers to filter the data based on different criteria.
Evaluation Criteria: Report design, use of visualizations, interactivity.
Part 3: Advanced Analytics
7. Statistical Analysis
Problem Statement: Perform a statistical analysis on a given dataset to identify significant
trends and correlations. Provide a summary of your findings.
Requirements:

Present the results using visualizations.
Evaluation Criteria: Correctness of analysis, clarity of summary, and visual presentation.
8. Predictive Analytics
Problem Statement: Build a predictive model to forecast sales for the next quarter using
historical sales data. Explain the steps taken and the rationale behind your model choice.
Requirements:
Use Python, R, or a similar tool to build the model.
Document the data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation steps.
Evaluation Criteria: Accuracy of the model, clarity of documentation, and rationale.
Part 4: Scenario-Based Questions
9. Real-World Problem Solving
Question: Imagine you are given a large dataset with customer transactions. How would you
approach the task of identifying key customer segments and their behaviors? Describe the
steps and tools you would use.
Evaluation Criteria: Problem-solving approach, understanding of segmentation techniques,
choice of tools.
10. Data-Driven Decision Making
Question: A company wants to launch a new product and has collected survey data on
customer preferences. How would you use this data to help the company make an informed
decision? Outline your approach.
Evaluation Criteria: Approach to data analysis, use of visualization tools, and ability to derive
insights
